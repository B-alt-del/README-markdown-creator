## Description

The Motivation for this project was to spend less time writing future README.md files and more time working on the projects themselves. This Generator quickly creates a README markdown file that can be used for any and all future projects. During the development I learned how to use node and inquirer to take input from the user  through the command line and then use those inputs to create the README unique to their project. (This README.md was created using the Generator)
